		<strong>Dear XXX_CLIENTFIRSTNAME,</strong>

		<p>
			Thank you for the opportunity to submit a quotation for your consideration for the supply and installation of Solar Control window film.  
			There are a number of things to consider when choosing a Window Film installer and the product that they propose to install for you.<br/>
			Please see below some pertinent information.  
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Installation:</strong>
			<br/>
			For peace of mind and guaranteed results, installation should be carried by trained and experienced technicians under supervision of a Window Film Association of Australia and New Zealand (WFAANZ) accredited operator and within the guidelines and standards as dictated by the WFAANZ.  As expected, only Window Energy Rating Scheme (WERS) accredited operators can provide a nationally recognized WERS certificate.  
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Warranty:</strong>
			<br/>
			The film manufacturer warranties the film against failure and includes adhesion, bubbling and delaminating. 
			Warranty period for residential installations is Lifetime for Internal film. The installer is required to carry the warranty for the quality of the installation.  
			The extent of the warranty limited to the value of the installation and only members of the WFAANZ have agreed to comply with industry best practices. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Window Energy Rating Scheme  (WERS):</strong>
			<br/>
			The WERS for films program is owned and operated by Australian Window Association (AWA) in conjunction with Window Film Association of Australia and New Zealand (WFAANZ).  
			<br/>
			The aim of the program is to simplify the technical and complex energy properties of glazing systems in to a star rating system that is universally adopted by Architects, 
			Designers and Energy Assessors.  The system is extended to include Solar Control Window Film.  
			To qualify, the film must be independently tested and rated.  The installer or consultant must be accredited by the WFAANZ and trained and accredited in the WERS program. 
		</p>

			<strong>Green and Clean:</strong>
			<br/>
			Quality Solar Control Window Film is one of the very few products that are Carbon negative.  
			That means that it saves more energy when installed than it takes to manufacture the product.  
			Not only are you taking positive step to control your internal climate but also reducing your carbon footprint by installing 
			a passive system that is used in nearly every country in the world. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong><u>Considerations:</u></strong>
			<br/>
			The Home receives high levels of solar radiation and heat incursion making the northern and western areas hot 
			and allowing high levels of Ultra Violet incursion to floors and soft furnishings and significant Glare issues. 
			Low E  Window Film will also assist in retaining heat in the cooler winter months
