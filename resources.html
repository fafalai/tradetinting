                        The most accepted method used to measure heat is British Thermal Units (BTU). BTU is the amount heat necessary to raise the Temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
                        The BTU method can used to calculate energy savings when Air Conditioning and energy rates are reconsolidated.

                        This light band is responsible for only 3% of solar energy. Ultra Violet light contributes to about 40% of Fade in floors and furnishings.  
                        It is also responsible for the cause of various Medical problems such as skin Cancer. All of the UVC (100Nm-260Nm) and most of the UVB (260Nm-320Nm)  
                        light bands do not reach earth through the atmosphere.

                        TSER is an important measurement of the window films ability to reject solar heat in the form of Visual Light (44% of heat) and Infrared Light (53% of heat). 
                        Clear glass transmits very high levels of both Visual and Infrared Light.

                        There is a great deal of work being done in the industry with IR Films, also known as Spectrally Selective films.  
                        As the Infra Red Light Band carries 55% of solar energy, Films targeting that specific Light Bands and becoming readily available .  
                        Some very light VLT films can have high heat rejection.  The IR rejection is a percentage of the IR Solar Energy rejected by the film, 
                        however it is important to consider that it is the percentage of the 55% of the total Solar Energy carried in the Infra Red Light Band.  
                        (SIRR) Selective Infra Red Rejection  is the percentage of IR radiation that is not directly transmitted through a glazing system.
                        (IRER) Infra Red Energy Rejection is the percentage of Near Infrared Energy Rejection as measured between 780-2500nm.

                        Shading Coefficient is the measure of the performance  of the entire glazing system to control solar energy.  
                        The lower the heat gain, the better performance from the glazing system and hence the lower Shading Coefficient number.

                        Low E films are greatly beneficial to cold climate areas.  Emissivity is the products ability to reflect radiant heat back in the direction of the source.    
                        For example, if you are heating a room, a Low E window film will direct a higher portion of heat back into the room than other window films.                            
                        The lower the emissivity number the better its ability.

                        Glare is best known as bright light.  It can enter rooms more so in the colder months when the sun is lower in the sky.
